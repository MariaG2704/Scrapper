I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-python/ as instructions for how to create the server and client socket and the syntax for exceptions <br />
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-multi-threading-python/ as instructions on how to create an operate a thread in relation to the server_socket <br />

I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket-programming-with-multi-threading-in-python as further instrutions on how to further operate and create a thread a how it relates to the client and server sockets <br />

I used https://realpython.com/python-sockets/ for further background knowlegdge on socket functions <br />
