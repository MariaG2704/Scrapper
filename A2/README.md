I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-multi-threading-python/ as instructions on how to create an operate a thread in relation to the server_socket

I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket-programming-with-multi-threading-in-python as further instrutions on how to further operate and create a thread a how it relates to the client and server sockets
